# discord-chatbot
This is a discord chatbot that can communicate in a somewhat humanly manner with others on its server.
This chatbot was initially designed and coded to work in the Repl.it cloud (i.e. it was designed to run in the cloud forever).
Provided is the source code for the chatbot; you can also access the original chatbot code here: https://replit.com/@ThunderClap/BotModulated#main.py
The server onwhich the bot is live is currently still under development... I may add its link here as well after its development is complete.
